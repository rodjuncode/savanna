# Savanna
This is an implementation of genetic algorithms, inspired by how lions organize theirselves into prides. Each pride has an independent GA setting and, besides the regular processing, generate also rogue lions. These roghe lions navigate between among the other prides, trying to become the alpha lion.

# Examples
You can find examples of using the Savanna implementation to solve two classic problems:
* finding the maximum of the function y = x^2;
* the travelling salesman problem.
